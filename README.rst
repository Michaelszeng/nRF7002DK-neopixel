NeoPixels on nRF Connect SDK
###########

NOTE: This only runs on nRF5340 and requires a Clock Speed of 128 MHz or above. See the `newer version of this repository <https://github.com/Michaelszeng/nRF-Connect-SDK-Neopixel-Addressable-RGB-LEDs>` that *should* work with all Nordic Chips, and uses the nrfx GPIO API instead.
